        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Star"> Patrick Star</a> is one of the ten main characters from the animated series <cite>Spongebob Squarepants</cite>.
        He is a pink starfish that lives under a rock in the underwater city of Bikini Bottom. Patrick loves to
        hang out with his best friend, Spongebob Squarepants. Together, they make the most of the day with fun
        activities and adventures!
